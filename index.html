  <h1 class= "text-center">Welcome!</h1><br>
  <p class= "mx-3 text-center">Hello my name is Jesse and I have been playing RS on and off for the past 15 years. I have hit a stage on my IronMan account where I would like to layout some goals to keep me on track. I went to Zybez in the hope of making a Goals and Achievement thread to do this and share with the community but found it has been shut down. I am currently studying ICT, doing a bit of programming and web development and thought this might be a good opportunity for my first webpage! This will probably be a work in progress for quite some time and possibly forever as I learn my way around web development.

            <p><em>19-01-2021</em><br>Completed an Elite Clue that I obtained while fishing, happened to get a Master Clue from it! I have only completed 2 Master Clues on this account and was keen to give it a go, but on the first step I got a flared trouser requirement, I don't have them and am not ready to commit to the Easy Clue grind yet so dropped the clue and went on my way.</p><hr>

          <p><em>19-01-2021</em><br>Had a look at the OSRS Ironman Checklist and it reminded me I had yet to obtain the fishing outfit. Seeing as though I am doing a lot of AFK fishing whilst studying, thought it would be good to get done asap. The first piece I obtained were the waders (legs). I clicked to bank all on the interface and continued playing trawler, what I did not notice was that my bank was full and the waders dropped underneath me, I did not have ground items on and lost them. I would have finished the set at 48 trips but because of losing the waders had to go on for a last piece. Luckily I managed to get them in 4 more trips, so not too bad!</p><hr>

          <p><br><em>09-01-2021</em><br>Went on the hunt for the good ol' Gout Tuber to continue the Karamja Diaries. It proved a bit longer to find than I would have thought, originally I was just going to collect two of each mask to create a shield of each type and be able to keep a mask of each type aswell but then just ended up collecting them all.</p>
          <p>The (food) masks are the white ones, the (poison) is green and the (disease) is brown. Going off the odds above I either got quite lucky on broodoo events or unlucky on the tuber hahaha.<hr>
