The first one is Barrows, I need to do some barrows pretty badly so I thought this was a good opportunity especially with a bond up for grabs. Missed a couple days but might be able to make up for it! Added a Barrows tele to my Portal Nexus to make trips a bit more convenient.</p><hr>

        <p><em>20-01-2021</em><br>Have had Making Friends with My Arm complete for quite a while now but have been slacking on my herb runs mainly due to not having herb seeds. I usually get them passively through Slayer but haven't been doing much of that lately as I have been aiming for other goals on the account. Have started to do a little bit of Master Farmer pickpocketing here and there now to stay on top of seeds and built the Fire of Nourishment today to unlock my 8th Herb Patch! One more to go, just have to complete Morytania Elite Diaries...</p><hr>

        <p><em>19-01-2021</em><br>Completed an Elite Clue that I obtained while fishing, happened to get a Master Clue from it! I have only completed 2 Master Clues on this account and was keen to give it a go, but on the first step I got a flared trouser requirement, I don't have them and am not ready to commit to the Easy Clue grind yet so dropped the clue and went on my way.</p><hr>

      <p><em>19-01-2021</em><br>Had a look at the OSRS Ironman Checklist and it reminded me I had yet to obtain the fishing outfit. Seeing as though I am doing a lot of AFK fishing whilst studying, thought it would be good to get done asap. The first piece I obtained were the waders (legs). I clicked to bank all on the interface and continued playing trawler, what I did not notice was that my bank was full and the waders dropped underneath me, I did not have ground items on and lost them. I would have finished the set at 48 trips but because of losing the waders had to go on for a last piece. Luckily I managed to get them in 4 more trips, so not too bad!</p><hr>

      <p><br><em>09-01-2021</em><br>Went on the hunt for the good ol' Gout Tuber to continue the Karamja Diaries. It proved a bit longer to find than I would have thought, originally I was just going to collect two of each mask to create a shield of each type and be able to keep a mask of each type aswell but then just ended up collecting them all.</p>
      <p>The (food) masks are the white ones, the (poison) is green and the (disease) is brown. Going off the odds above I either got quite lucky on broodoo events or unlucky on the tuber hahaha.<hr>
